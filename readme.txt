Change the server back to its original point, but incorporate some of the new code.✅

Need to know what users are in the sessions across all clients, hold all of the data in the server to send down when a new client joins.✅

Start adding to the arrays and assigning shapes to user ids. These will be taken for the server. Feed server array into client array if possible to help with generating shapes.✅

Figure out array setup, still use users.js for control. Need to figure out why it's returning undefined.✅

Set it up so an array is attached to geometry with an id from the server array! 

Add some more interaction to the dashboard client page, make sure it is intuitive on first visit. Some way of identifying users on this page also.
